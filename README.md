## Human in the Loop
I’m a Human in the Loop: **data analyst** and **programming historian**, working on **web archives** and **Internet history**.
- Research Librarian at the National Library of Norway (NB)
- Affiliated with NB's [Web Archive](https://www.nb.no/samlingen/nettarkivet/forskning/) and [DH-lab](https://dh.nb.no/)

### Research Interests
I am committed to making the petabytes of web archives, collected since the 1990s, more available for research. Consequently, I am particularly interested in methodologies for studying the archived web, including:
- text mining and NLP techniques,
- link data and network analysis,
- data visualisation.
