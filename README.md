## Jon Tønnessen
I’m a Human in the Loop: **data analyst** and **programming historian**, working on **web archives** and **Internet history**.

- Research Librarian at the National Library of Norway (NB)
- Affiliated with NB's [Web Archive](https://www.nb.no/samlingen/nettarkivet/forskning/) and [DH-lab](https://dh.nb.no/)

### Research Interests
I’m deeply engaged in how the petabytes of web archives, collected since the 1990s, can be made available for research.

As a consequence, I have a great interest in methodologies for studying the archived web, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.
I’m especially interested in:
- text mining for semantic analysis
- digital source criticism
- research infrastructure [^1]
- data visualisation
- collections as data [^2]
- critical approaches
- FAIR principles
- open science
